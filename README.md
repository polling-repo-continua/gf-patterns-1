# gf-patterns

This is a directory of some useful patterns I created for [Tomnomnom's](https://twitter.com/tomnomnom) amazing [gf](https://github.com/tomnomnom/gf) tool.
The patterns are mostly targeted on performing code security reviews, but can be applied for other purposes.

Some of my favorite patterns are based on bad code indicators, such as "TODO", "FIXME", "TEMPORARY FIX" etc.
Some of the patterns are based on Will Butlers [article on bad words](https://btlr.dev/blog/how-to-find-vulnerabilities-in-code-bad-words)

## Contribute
Feel free to contribute to this repository, as I will gladly add new pattern files and improved patterns!
